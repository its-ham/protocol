# DeFi has lost its way

Rememember the golden days, like 2 months ago? We were all having fun together playing large-scale coordination games. Everyone was making absurd paper gains and pretending they were going to cash out, staying up through the night to ape into the latest contract.

Well, somewhere between the sweet potatoes, sushi, meme factories, and testing in prod, DeFi lost its way. We stopped having fun, and started taking advantage of the situation, newcomers, and each other. Exhaustion set in.

That hollow pit in your stomach grew, and the thought we'd all pushed away finally bubbled to the surface: is DeFi really this fucking stupid?

## But it wasn't all bad, right?

No, it wasn't all bad. There are some cool things in DeFi

1. **Ownership**. There aren't many things in life that we truly own anymore. These dumb new projects are *ours*. üö©
2. **Privacy**. Everyone wants to have a secret, and everyone wants to be a secret agent. üïµÔ∏è
3. **Fun**. 2020 is too serious. If you can let yourself, live a little and enjoy the ride. üé¢

# A way forward

What do we need to get excited again?

Something fun. Something private. Something that's **ours**.

Welcome to HAM, a financial MMORPG that isn't fucking stupid.
